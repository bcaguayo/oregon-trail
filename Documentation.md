### The Oregon Trail

We need to do:

Have all modules, types, function declarations, some tests

Modules:
- Text.hs           Store text to display on screen, not testing
                    In the future, read a txt file
                    Miles

- Main.hs           Prints Text
                    Checks GameState

- Resources.hs      Stores Natural numbers
                    Implemented like StateMonad
                    TEST functions like modifyState
                    Miles

- Events.hs         Returns to Main (Event): Outcomes
                    Get user input and changes state
                    Advances Mileage
                    TEST
                    Vince

- GameState.hs      Checks Mileage
                    Ends the Game
                    TEST

- check if game end condition has been achieved

- Regular Options:
1. Keep going
2. talk to locals
3. shop
4. hunt
...

- Random Events: pick three or four

* Ask TAs

WIP:
- Get State and StateMonad from Solutions or delete
- ask about substraction
- make new map
